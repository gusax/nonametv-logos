The logos are stored in the directory 100x100/. Smaller versions of the logos
are created automatically from the files in 100x100/. 

The original/ catalog is used to store the originals for the logos for
future reference. This catalog is not used in the update process.

After updating a logo, open a web-browser to the url

https://sol.holmlund.se/cgi-bin/update_logos.cgi

This will upload the new logos to tv.swedb.se and tvsajten.com.
